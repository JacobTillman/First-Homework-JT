This is a refactoring solution for marketing agency. Agency needs page to follow HTML semantic standards so it is optimized for search engines, as-well as clean up it's accessibility. 

Horiseon Social Solutions Services, Inc refactored website. I made changes to the HTML that fixed a link, added alt text to images for accessibility, and added a title to the page. I also made changes to the CSS file to consolidate classes and order them in a coherent manner when compared to the HTML.
